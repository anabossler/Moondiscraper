[{"points": "92", "title": "Hickinbotham 2018 Trueman Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)", "description": "\n                      This vintage of Trueman emerges as a quintessential example of McLaren Vale Cab, round in shape and fruit forward, backed by spice and savory herbs. It offers ripe blackberry, violet, tobacco leaf, olive and peppery spice flavors. In the mouth the plump fruit is tempered by the variety's typically powerful tannins. The juxtaposition works well, although it lacks some of the elegance and complexity inherent in the cooler 2017 vintage. Drink 2022\u20132036.
