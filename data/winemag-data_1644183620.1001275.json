Indeed, Felton's Block 5 Pinot, in particular, seems cut from a similar cloth, but this bears the unmistakable mark of Two Paddocks. It's highly perfumed and downright sexy, a tightrope walk of evocative flavor (think fresh red berries, mushrooms and dried flowers) and ultrafine, ethereal tannins. It's so approachable and complete, in fact, that it'd be tempting to think it's simpler than it is. But wound up in one harmonious package there's a lot of layers to this little beauty.
