[{"points": "94", "title": "Paul Dolan 2019 Made with Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County)", "description": "\n                      This reasonably priced wine is arguably one of Mendocino County's best Cabernets, year in and year out. Aromatic, complex, nicely ripe and full in body, it starts with enticing aromas of toasted oak, pencil shavings and cigar box followed by deep layers of black cherry, blueberry, anise and cocoa. Moderate, well-integrated tannins beef up the texture nicely and bode well for mid-term aging. Best from 2026.
